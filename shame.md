# Shame

Definition:  
Shame is a distressing emotion stemming from self-disapproval or humiliation due to actions or situations conflicting with personal values or societal norms, leading to feelings of embarrassment, guilt, and a desire to hide.  
Shame is one of the emotions that undermine self-esteem. Feelings associated with shame include inadequacy, inferiority, and insignificance.  

This I'll tell for my future self, I'd like to be developed to the better in this when I read this next time: I played Village People's Go West from my phone while waiting for the metro train, I played it with sounds on, scary :P Small things like this gradually take me to the better direction, I feel.

I wonder what will be the next shameful challenge? The step needs to be small enough, that you feel comfortable taking it - but long enough, in the sense that before you wouldn't have behaved that way.

Non-essential text:  

I have a lot of issues with shame.  

I rarely talk in meetings because of possible judgement coming from others.  
I rarely say to waiter elaborately if food was good in a restaurant because of possibly being judged also.  
I simply rarely give out any hints to others about how I truly would like to be and behave. I just hide.  
I'm way too afraid to sing or dance.  
The list goes on and on.

However,

Just recently, I joined a religious meeting for non-religious people.   
The folks there were extremely trusting and open.  
So in the meeting I opened my mouth.   
Because it felt like   
And got addicted to asking questions during the day.  
I even started to boast a bit, asking *too many* questions.  
So later I started to feel shame about **that**.  

But later I realized that shame is a wonderful sign in a human's life. 

Better name for shame would be Tolerance. Tolerance of being judged.  
Shame is also the feeling of being judged by others.  

When you born, you have very little shame about yourself.  
When you grow up, you bump into the real world and you need to get ready for being judged.  
At first you can't stand any judgement.  
But shame indicates that you've grown a bit and also that there is a long road of shame ahead of you.  
As an adult you don't feel shame anymore about the things you used to.

I, for crying out loud, was ashamed of using or buying deodorant when I was 16 or so because I found it very intimate subject.
Or watching Ally Mc'Beal from TV even if I wanted to, but brother kept shouting how stupid show that is, so I did hide once again.

It is good for a person in their life to yearn to act constantly more shamefully, so that they can tolerate shame even more. But with a good strategy, so that it wouldn't annoy others too much.  

I also managed to compliment the food in a restaurant. And I had a good reason for it, the food was good. Thinking about complementing made me nervous at first, but I figured that my ideal self would do that, so that's what I did. I felt the shame immediately, but the waiters took it extremely nicely and laughed even sincerely.

But it will take years of practice before I actually get better at handling shame.
